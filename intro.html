  <h1>	Meaning of psychology</h1>
  <p class="ovaflo">
Root definition;
<p>
The word psychology is derived from Greek words, the  prefix <i class="spaic">“Psyche”</i> means mind, soul or spirit and <i class="spaic">“Logos”</i>
means knowledge, discourse or study.So  literally,
Psychology is the study of mind. It is concerned with a wide area of interest.
</p>
<br />As study of mind, psychology study people in different points of views.  In this topic ( introduction to psychology)
We will cover five approaches in summary   <hr />
When we attempts to relate a parson's actions to events taking place within the nervous system and  studying   relationship between  person thought or actions and events taking place  within nervous system ,  For example , measuring person part of when is excited, crying or laughing. This approach is called <b>neurobiological approach.</b>  Which attempts to relate human behavior to electrical and chemical activities taking place in the brain and central nervous system <hr />
We can also focus on individual's behavior,  by behavior means those activities or action  of  an organism that can be observable (overt). For example, person who sleep a lot can tell us that is lonely inside. Or by observing body language for example  "your toes tend to point directly towards people you’re interested in". This approach is known as<b> behavioral approach</b> . Behavioral approach is also known as s-r psychology, means stimulus and respond . Stimuli is elicit behavioral response.  For example horn  behind your car at traffic light when you was busy with your Smartphone    is stimuli  and action you are taking to drive is response,  also an alarm of  low battery is stimuli, your  action of plugging in  is response .  One thing to note is that, behavioral (s-r psychology) does not concerned about inside of organism (mental process) . <hr />
When we study the how mind process incoming information  from sensory   this called <b>cognitive approach</b>.     The mental processes by which sensory information  is transformed in various ways, coded and stored in  memory  is referred as cognition.  Remembering, perceiving and thinking are all cognitive process.  Cognitive psychologist  are interested much about conscious mental process ( by conscious  means all mental processes that we are aware of) . These include perception, judgment memory, thinking (such as ideation, imagination, belief, reasoning, etc.).<hr />
At some time we  experience Happiness,  Sadness,  Anger , Surprise, Disgust , Fear,  Confusion ,  Excitement and  Desire. We can't avoid this but  partial or perfectly control them.  Mental event  which we are not aware  with is called unconscious. The approach that study mental events that we are not aware with (unconscious ) is called <b>psychoanalytic approach</b>  . This approach was developed by Sigmund Freud, who assumes that our behavior  is influenced by unconscious process of which Freud  believe that we are not aware with.
<hr />
Lastly  some  psychologist  believes that our action depend on particular  phenomena, they focus on individual's own perception  and interpretation of events.  They emphasize  those "human" qualities that distinguish people from animals, this is free will and  self-actualization.  Some theories of phenomenological are called humanistic theories.  To them, we are responsible for our own actions rather than controlled by unconscious or stimuli and responses. Self -actualization means our natural tendency  develop our potential to the fullest.  Study mind in this way is called <b> phenomenological approach</b> <hr />
Early definition;
   Miller (1966) defined psychology as the science of mental life. Mental life refers to three phenomena which are behaviors, thoughts and emotions. Miller (1966) psychology is the science of mental life, (Harmon’s worth: Penguin)<br />
   <div class="filta">
    Generally  (Contemporary definition) we can define psychology as scientific  studies of  behavior   and mental process both conscious and unconscious . The term behavior and mental process means many things including what people do, their thought, their feelings, their perception, reasoning process, their memories and even in one sense their biological activities that keep their bodies functioning
     Why psychology is scientific study  ( by scientific study means knowledge gained through systematic principle  rather that intuition or natural ability) ?  The aim of science in psychology is to discover and finding the relationship  between variables. Variable is something that change or something that take different values. Varying means to "change" . This  refers to the facts that the study of psychology is based on information or data collection through a set of systematic procedures known as scientific methods.
     It can also be defined as scientific study of human or animal behavior that can be subjected to a process of observation and experimentation.
   </div>



Often we experiment how one variable affect another, if we find relationship between the use of  mobile phone (especially Smartphone)  among  lower educations students (primarily, secondary) and increasing of sexual behavior . Experimenters can control or  be able to manipulate Smartphone directly  while sexual behavior depend on Smartphone.  Variable that can directly controlled by experimenter is called independent variable while that one which can be controlled indirectly id called dependent variable.  From our example Smartphone is independence variable while sexual behavior dependent variable.
But not all variable can be manipulated of can be controlled by experimenter, for example we can decide to find out relationship between  child raised  by one parent and his/her marriage life, none of this can be controlled. Here we will find correlation between variable.  Correlation coefficient  is represented by small r, we can state positive relationship by r+1.00 or negative relationship by r-1.00. And if there is no relationship, it can be expressed as  r.00

  <h3>ORIGIN OF PSYCHOLOGY</h3>
  <p>
The history of psychology as a scholar studies the  mind and behavior dates back to the ancient Greeks, there is also evidence through in ancient Egypt. Psychology was branch of philosophy until 1870s when it developed as independent discipline in German and the United States.
Psychology borders on various others field including biology, neuroscience, artificial intelligence, sociology and anthropology.
There are number of philosophers who wrote on origins of psychology. Thier principle application believed that the mind and body are two distinct elements with the mind having a life of its own both before birth and after death.
Aristotle however argued that mind and body are related and form as one unity, one could not exist without the others.
