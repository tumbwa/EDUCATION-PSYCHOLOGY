    <h3>CHILD COGNITIVE DEVELOPMENT</h3>
<p>
  	Cognitive Psychology- studies mental processes including how people think, perceive, remember and learn.
  focusing on a child's development in terms of information processing, conceptual resources, perceptual skill, language learning, and other aspects of the development. Some refer our brain as computer, as it takes input, process information, and store and retrieve it. Human life and biological support system are governed directed and coordinated by the brain. Brain carries its functions through a constant exchange of message (mental process).
</p>
<p>
  The mental process of human being which include how people know, understand, process information, make judgment and decisions, use of language and understand is called cognition. Cognition depend on parent’s genes/ inheritance and interaction with environment . Increasing of cognition ability  and change  is known as cognitive development
</p>
<p>
  <i class="zuu">Cognitive development</i>- means  the increase development of a children mental ability in reasoning, problem solving recalling, language perception, understanding, logic etc.
</p>

<p>
  A human baby is born with a few practical instincts and reflexes such as sucking  and grasping. The initial infant cognitive structure suppose to incorporate only to those cognitive abilities and / potentials which help them to do such acts. Swiss psychologist and biologist Jean Piaget term this cognitive potential ability as <i class="zuu"> schemata</i>, singular schema.
<span class="wew">  Schema therefore represents a unity of one’s cognitive structure in shape of general potential to perform a particular class of behaviors like sucking.</span>
</p>

<p>
  The various schemas with their contents thus form a basic human mind structure. The areas schemas represent those reflexes and instincts that are biologically inherited.
  Due to physical and social environment child form different schemata led to modification of cognitive structure as he/ she adapt.
</p>

</div>
<h5>FACTORS AFFECTING COGNITIVE DEVELOPMENT</h5>
<p>
  According to Piaget, there is a relationship between intelligence and heredity, to him intelligence is the product of <i class="zuu">hereditary factor</i> and environment but neither alone determines intelligence.
  <i class="zuu">Environmental factor</i> for intelligence include social, physical, economic up brings, health care, nutrition, stability of family and states etc.
</p>

<h5>PIAGET COGNITIVE DEVELOPMENT THEORY</h5>
<p>
  To <i class="njano"> Piaget, cognitive development </i>was a progressive reorganization of mental processes resulting from biological maturation and environmental experience. He believed that children construct an understanding of the world around them, experience discrepancies between what they already know and what they discover in their environment, then adjust their ideas accordingly. According to jean piaget  all child over the world develop cognitively in sequence.

Sensory motor children do not use language at this stage or symbol. But explore the world through sensory and motor activities / sense and motor. Child may begin trial and error experiment, exploring environment around them even imitate the observed behavior of others. At first they can study only visually  but they soon learn to reach  for  and explore them with fingers and mouth . In this stage , they learn object permanents that object continue to exist  even if when is not present to be  to the sense , this occur in the  first two  years.</p>

However, they now can think in images and symbols. at this stage child begin to use symbol  to conceptualize the environments . Children represent objects with words and images Thinking in this stage is still egocentric, meaning the child has difficulty seeing the viewpoint of others. Children tend to stick to their own viewpoint, rather than consider the view of others. Indeed,

  While children in the preoperational and concrete operational levels of cognitive development perform combined arithmetic operations (such as addition and subtraction) with similar accuracy, children in the concrete operational level of cognitive development have been <br /> able to perform both addition problems and subtraction problems with overall greater fluency.

2.	Help in instructional design and teaching aids preparation.<br />
3.	Setting of the environmental that is friendly to cognitive developments.<br />

<p class="sikia">
  The stage of cognitive growth of a person differ from another. Cognitive development or thinking is an active process from the beginning to the end of life. Intellectual advancement happens because people at every age and developmental period looks for cognitive equilibrium. To achieve this balance, the easiest way is to understand the new experiences through the lens of the preexisting ideas. Infants learn that new objects can be grabbed in the same way of familiar objects, and adults explain the day's headlines as evidence for their existing worldiview
