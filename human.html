  <H3 class="zuu">CHILD DEVELOPMENT</H3>
<p>
  Developmental  psychology deals with how people grow and change over the course of  lifetime.  developmental psychology not only concerned with the physical changes that occur as people grow; they also look at the social, emotional, and cognitive development that occurs throughout life.
</p>
<i>Generally</i><p class="ona">
  Is a biological and psychological change that occurs in human being between conception and the end of adolescence to death as individual progress from dependably to autonomy
</p>

Development- refers to long-term personal changes that have multiple source and multiple effects. It is a lifelong beginning before birth and extending to death.  physical changes largely drived the process, as our cognitive abilities advanced and declined function in old age.  Our development depend on heredity and environments, our behavior and ability at any stage in life, depend on continuously interaction with them. For example all human infants are born with ability to learn language, this is only for human , other organism does not have this ability. This is something  that are biological inherited.<br />
Generally our development is affected by two factors, which are <i class="filta">heredity</i> and <i class="filta">environments</i>. For example ability to speak particular language  at particular stage  is result of  maturation, while speaking language depend on culture (which will determine types of language you speak) is a result of learning in order to gain or acquire that language. Development depend on the sequence , usually simple to complex actions or events. For example infant will start sitting before crawling before running.


	<b>There are various defined period in a child development, this is exampleof age related development periods </b> :<br />

•	New born (age 0-4 weeks)<br />
•	Infant (age 4 weeks – 1 year)<br />
•	Toddler (age 1 year -3 years)<br />
•	Preschool (age 3 year -6 year)<br />
•	School age (6 -11 years )<br />
•	Adolescent ( 11 -18 years )<br />



<H3>CHILD GROWTH:</H3>
 represent physical changes in a quantitative sense over time the changes is result of two variables i.e. Time and nutrition. We all have changed height, weight, size or foot, head, palm and even in the nose and eye <i class="njano">(Omar 2006)</i>. Although some use the word growth and development interchangeably as synonymous terms.
In strictest the word growth means having / becoming longer and heavier thus the increase in length, height and weight which can be sure.
Nutrition is the most important factor which may facilitate or dwarf child growth. <br />
<i class="njano">Jean Piaget</i> define child growth as an increase of height and weight and others body changes that occur as a child matures where hair grows, teeth come in, come out and in again eventually puberty. All these are growth process and are unique in his or her way. Yet there are certain similarities that children share with each other and no children grow at the perfect, steady rate throughout this period or childhood.
Some week or month are slightly slower grow (min, growth of sprats)
Growth sprats is a rapid rise in height and weight are most visible in first two year  life and around puberty in both period tremendous amount of growth take place in short time Usually kids enter puberty between age 8 to 13 years in girls and 10 -15 in boys and last for 2-5 years this associated with several development include  appearance of pubic and under arm hair, growth and development of sex organs in girls the onset of menstruation.

 <h3>MATURATION</h3>
	<span>In order to teach successfully you must consider  two factors</span>
<i>1. Stage of development</i>
<i>2. Their background knowledge</i> <br />

<p class="sikia">
  The level of maturation will determine the fort of things which a child can able to learn.
  Our biological predisposition in which we are born with which we are born with are expressed itself through the process of maturation. Maturation refer to the inborn(innate) determined sequence of growth or body changes that are relatively independent from training /experience.
  If all member or particular specie develop certain behavior at about the same age (particular time)   we will suspect that  behavior is result of maturation rather than training/learning.   Maturity prepare our readiness to learn, hence some behaviors are results of learning and training.
</p><p>

  •	MATURATION:   can also be defined  period where children show the signs of growth of mind and development of body. Naturally, particularly muscles, bones and nervous system maturation under his the orderly sequence observed in the unfolding or many abilities such as learning how to crawl or walk.
  •	The rate of maturation varies from one person to another although the order is virtually universal e.g. We expect to see strength and coordination need for sitting before needed for crawling.
  •	According to<i class="njano"> Omar (2006)</i> maturation period is associated with several maturation which marked by milestones as menstruation for girls and ejaculation for boys.
</p>
<hr />
                  <h6>  STAGES OF HUMAN DEVELOPMENT</h6>
<p>
  we can categorize stage of human development into two stage. first stage is pre-natal and second stage is post-natal. <i class="ran">natal is of or related to birth. so simply  this stages are before birth  and second stages is after.</i>
  Pre –natal development; Period from conception to birth it is process by which in nine month a single cell develops into highly complex human being over 800 billion cells. This stage is divided into three stages which are:

</p>
<p>
<i class="zuu">  I.	Germinal period:</i> Almost immediately after fertilization zygote the process of cell division that will eventually produce a human body made up of billion of cells.
</p>
<p>
  <i class="zuu" >II.	The Embryonic period:</i> Within 4 weeks after conception the organism is already about      long  e.g. heart is beating to pump blood through microscopic veins and arteries, the beginning of brain, kidney, livers and digestive track appeared. Indentations at the top will eventually become jaws, eyes and ears.
</p>
<p>
  <i class="zuu">III.	The Fetal period :</i> About eight weeks after
  Conceptions when the major organs have taken shape, here development shift from rudimentary (body part with no function) to organism structure and establish their functions. Now is ready to start life as a fully developed infant.
</p>
                                <h3>FACTOR S AFFECTING PRE – NATAL DEVELOPMENT</h3>
<p>
  Although most pregnant follow normal course of developments and most badness to be normal. Some factors like generic abnormality may affect the developing of fetus.
</p>
<p>
  •	Diseases to affecting mother during pregnancy
</p>
<p>
  •	Poor quality and quantity of dieting consumption  of the part of the mother
</p>
<p>
  •	Psychological violence or treatment of the mother
</p>
<p>
  •	Heavy drinking , smoking ,cocaine by mother to be
</p>
<p>
  •	Accident or trauma  ( injury of physical or biological / psychological )
</p>

                              <h5> POST –NATAL DEVELOPMENT</h5>

This is the period after birth, the remarked characteristics are:
<p>
  1.	Infant physical development in the first two years of life is dramatic
</p>
<p>
  1.	Infant physical development in the first two years of life is dramatic
</p>
<p>
  2.	Normally  in the span of 12 months become capable sitting anywhere standing, climbing and walking
</p>
<p>
  3.	Decelerates growth during second year but some activities increase life running and jumping
</p>
<p>
  4.	Three years child perform new tricks like climbing and making her body what can do.
</p>

<h5>DEVELOPMENTAL CHANGES DURING ADOLESCENCE STAGE</h5>
Common physical features:
	<p>
    Very rapid  growth accompanied by gradual development of productive organs and secondary sex characteristics<br />
  girls -breast development<br />
  Boys – beard growth<br />
  All – appearance of public hair<br />
</p>
<h5 class="zuu">PSYCHOLOGICAL EFFECTS OR PHYSICAL CHANGES</h5>
<p>
  The matter is “ satisfied ” or “ dissatisfied ”  the way they look themselves or by family members and people around will determine how they perceive themselves .some are most happy while others are quite happy , e.g.  A girl may have looked powered to have medium size breast small or big breast may affect her attitudes.
  Social trending may also influence ones views over their body.
</p>

<h6>	CHALLENGES FACING ADOLESCENTS</h6>
<p>
  1.	Increased in sexual desire<br />
  2.	They gave for independence from teachers , parents and adults<br />
  3.	Boredom<br />
  4.	Engaging themselves into favorite activities like dancing , drinking<br />
  5.	Loss interest in chores such as study<br />
  6.	Cling desperately to the advice of peer groups in most of issues pertinent to life<br />
</p>
 <H3>APPLICATION</H3>
<P>
  1.	Understand more about psychological process in perception and socialization
</P>
<P>
  2.	Facilitate effective communication learners and tellers
</P>
<P>
  3.	To provide information about their growth and development so the changes they undergo is experienced as less traumatic
</P>
<P>
  4.	Providing them with guidance “ add others in discussion
