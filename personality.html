<h4>SIGMUD FREUD PERSONALITY THEORY</h4>
<P>
  The father of depth psychology (also known as psycho dynamic or clinical psychology ) . Friends Psychoanalytic theory explains about three level of personality namely conscious, subconscious and unconscious where as a unconscious acts as determinants   of personality.
 Psychoanalytic theory proposes that may deeply felt emotions and thoughts are found in the unconscious. The unconscious level contains the desire, wishes, needs and impulses that are not aware of under normal circumstance.
Psychoanalysis as method for treating mental illness and theory which explains human behavior is often known as the talking cure.
</P>
	<span class="ran">Freud also stated that personality is composed of three systems that is Id, ego and super ego.</span>

    	Eros or life instincts help the individual to survive, it directs life sustaining activities such as respiration, eating, sex (Freud , 1925) the energy created by the life instincts is known as libido..</p>

The Ego develops from the Id during infancy .The goal is to satisfying the demands of the Id in a safe socially accepted way . it operates in both the conscious and unconscious mind. It includes the reason, judgment, planning, tolerance, memory, understanding, and so on.</p>

Our Ego tells us what is right and what is wrong it tries to prevent Id impulses from being expressed. Since most of Id impulses are socially unacceptable it evokes the feeling of guilt and shame (scolds or congratulated).</p>
</a>
  </div>
              <h4>DEFENSIVE MECHANISM</h4>
  <P>
    The basic dilemma of all human existence is that each element of the Psychic apparatus makes demands upon us that are incompatible with the other two. Inner conflict is mutable when there is a conflict between the goals of the Id and super Ego. The Ego acts as a referee and mediates this conflict. The Ego deploy various defense mechanisms ( Freud 1884, 1896) to prevent it from becoming over whelmed by anxiety.

<h5 class="zuu"> ERICK ERICKSON PERSONALITY DEVELOPMENT</h5>
<p>
  Erick Erickson (1902 - 1982)  was a German-American psychologist who together with his wife Joan, became known for his work on psychosocial development. He was influenced by Sigmund and Anna Freud and became famous for coining the phrase "identity crisis." Although Erikson lacked even a bachelor's degree, he served as a professor at Harvard and Yale.  develop psychoanalytic theory of psychosocial development comprising eight stages from infancy to adulthood in each stage the individual meets and must solve a major crisis or problem . If the crisis is not solved the individual is less able to solve crises at later stages (however in  later stage the person can solve an earlier crisis and continue developing favorably )
</p>

<p>
  As people attempt to solve in each crisis, they learn ways of dealing with society.<br />

Erick Erickson’s ideas were greatly influenced by Freud  psychoanalytic , Erickson was an ego psychologist , he emphasized by the role of culture and society and the conflicts that can take place within the ego itself. <br />
Erick Erickson maintained that personality develops in predetermined order and builds upon each previous stage. This called Epigenetic principle
<br />according to the Erickson, successful completion of each stage results in a health personality and the acquisition of basic virtues. Basic virtues are characteristic strengths with the ego can use to resolve subsequent crises.

As infants we ask ourselves if we can trust the world and we wonder if it's  safe place or it is full of unpredictable events and accidents waiting to happen?  . We learn that if we can trust someone now, we can also trust others in the future. If we experience fear, we develop doubt and mistrust.  the infant at this stage  is uncertain about the world in which live, to resolve these feelings of uncertainty, the infant looks towards their care giver (mother)  for stability and consistence.

If we get too much negative feedback, we start to feel inferior and lose motivation. At this stages our peer group will gain greater significance and will become source of the self – esteem as we  need to win approval. If initiative is not encouraged, if  it’s restricted by parents or teacher, then the we begins to feel inferior. Doubt our own abilities and therefore may not reach potential.
