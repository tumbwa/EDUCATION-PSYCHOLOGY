      <small>human and other organism</small>
    </div>
    <p class="mb-1"> <h6>what makes human being differ from other organism ?</h6>
     <h6>is because human have free will  (<i class="wew">ability to choose and act based of certin situation or phenomena </i> ) ?</h6>
   <h6>is because human being is choosen creature by GOD ?</h6>
<h6>is because we (human) are more intelligent ?</h6>
there might be so many answers on this althrough most people focuses on mind as factor that differentiate between human being and other organisms. or have boundaries and laws, like we( human) are totally disagree that father or mother can't have sex relationship with theire daughters or sons, the same Applies to people who are blood related. but this issue for other organisms is normal..
<br />
still when i look at animal like dog, who can see someone and react by burking because the man is new to dog or looks to be danger (criminal.

<p>
i realize that first this dog can <b>store information</b> that has memory to realize that someone is stranger or not. for trained dog , it showes ability to learn ( by conditioning) . where to attack, how to sport danger in environment and to alert owner and so many things
</p>
<br />
when i look at rat, hasitating to eat a piece of meat on the trap. <i class="filta">(thinking)</i><br /> when i look local chicken get out early morning and at evening return home.<i class="filta">(memory)</i>  <br /> when i look at mother lioness being sad for the death of cubs attack by hyena <i class="filta">(feeling)</i> <br /> when i look at nest structure how is designed  and its purpose <i class="filta">( skills, family, unity, security)</i>
<p>
i realize that , animals and other organisms like fishs and birds have ability to think and scanning environment before they act, they understand how things work or even to learn them.  . <b> so what makes human being differ from them ?</b>
</p>
<h6 class="ona">what i think about this ?</h6> the answer for the above question  is <i class="filta">language ability factor</i> what makes human being differ from other organisms like animals, birds and fish is unique ability to speak language .  no matter what kind of language we are using but as long as is a code that we exchange information in a group of people , this make different.
<b class="zuw">why language? </b> a new baby born know nothing about the world, but perform things best of Instinct. this are biological activity elping to servive. at this stage , apart from shape, no different between human being and animal or other organisms. as we develop and we learn language as first that help us to communicate with familiy members as we may request what we need and it is in this stage whare enviroment start to shape us bu giving as the order of the world through language.<br />
is language which help us to act on behavior that we think is good or is bad. society use language to impact KNOWLEDGE  SKILLS and ATTITUDES.
<<br /> is language that help as to store information help us to learn from past like what happened ? how it was ? . we also use past information to developed whare our ancestors stop (science and technology).<br /> in language we create laws. <br /> we use language to share knowledge , skills and attitudes. by sharing , we learn where other succed and where they failed thn we improve, although when it comes to moral , what is better for Tanazanian might not be  for chinese.
