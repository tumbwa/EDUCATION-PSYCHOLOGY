  <h3>MORAL DEVELOPMENT</h3>
  <p>
<b>KEY</b>
(1) Explain what the meaning of moral and emotional development<br />
(2) Describe piaget and Kohlberg’s theory of moral development and application in learning<br />
(3) Interpret the effect of morals and emotions on learner’s behaviors and the learning process<br />
(4) Determine ways of enhancing morality among learners<br />
</p>
<h6>Morality</h6>
<p>
– Criteria used to describe what is right and what is wrong .The basis principle or standard rule set by society or any group that conclude the right and wrong, good and bad, that judge intention, decision or action to be right or wrong. However the concept of morality may change from time to time , (in time)  and place it is not universality. Moral development means that individual develops the knowledge of what is right and what is wrong.
</p>
<p>
Both piaget and Kohlberg , Believe that the quantity of moral judgment change in regular and predictable ways as a person matures and intercut with others (socialization agents play its family and school are crucial )
</p>
<h6>PIAGATE BELIEF ON NATURE OF MORAL COGNITION
</h6>
<p>
Piaget  identified two basic in childhood morality developments.
</p>
<div class="list-group">
<a  class="list-group-item list-group-item-action flex-column align-items-start ">
  <div class="d-flex w-100 justify-content-between">
    <h5 class="mb-1">1.	Moral realism or morality of constraint</h5>
  </div>
  <p class="mb-1">
    Children think of moral behavior in term of consequence rather than intention and equate good behavior with conformity to adults what is interest to adult is right and what annoys them is wrong. Children think that whoever breaks the rule must be punished.
Regardless the rationality of  breaks the rule this behavior starts changing after 7 years age..</p>
</a>
<a  class="list-group-item list-group-item-action flex-column align-items-start">
  <div class="d-flex w-100 justify-content-between">
    <h5 class="mb-1">  2.	Morality of cooperation</h5>
  </div>
  <p class="mb-1">
    It involves the recognition of rules as rational conventions developed for goal attainment and an understanding of morality as a complex function of internality and age consequence. Sometimes the child may break the rules for sound reason.</p>
</a>
  </div>


<h4 class="ran">KOHLBERG STAGE OF MORAL DEVELOPMENT</h4>
<p>
Kohlberg identified levels of moral development in three levels with each of those levels composed of two stages.
</p>
<h5 class="zuu">PRE-CONVENTIONAL</h5>
<div class="list-group">
<a  class="list-group-item list-group-item-action flex-column align-items-start ">
  <div class="d-flex w-100 justify-content-between">
    <h5 class="mb-1">Punishment obedience orientation</h5>
    <small>STAGE 1.</small>
  </div>
  <p class="mb-1">
    The individual focus almost wholly on self and the physical consequences of the rewards and punishment handed out by authority figures that is physical consequence determine what is good or bad (how can avoid punishment ) egocentric.

  <small>Pre - convention</small></p>
</a>
<a  class="list-group-item list-group-item-action flex-column align-items-start">
  <div class="d-flex w-100 justify-content-between">
    <h5 class="mb-1"> Instrumental relativism orientation( reasoning )</h5>
    <small>STAGE 2.</small>
  </div>
  <p class="mb-1">
individuals shows an awareness of peers and associates and  use them for personal gains when occasion allows . Then what is satisfied one's own needs is good (what is it for me ) at this stages also children recognize that there is not fast just one right but different individual have different  viewpoints.
<small>Pre - convention</small>
</p>
</a>
</div>

<h5 class="zuu">CONVENTIONAL  ( MOST ADOLESCENNTS AND ADULTS ) level two</h5>
<P>
Begin internalizes the moral standards of valued adult role models. Authority is internalized but not questioned. Moral reasoning in conventional way to judge the morality of action by comparing them with society view of expectations . It also characterized by an acceptance of society conventions  concerning right and wrong.
</P>
<div class="list-group">
<a  class="list-group-item list-group-item-action flex-column align-items-start ">
  <div class="d-flex w-100 justify-content-between">
    <h5 class="mb-1">Good boy/nice girl orientation </h5>
    <small>STAGE 3.</small>
  </div>
  <p class="mb-1">
  individual attends to rules and regulations of selected groups which they identify and from which they try to get support and recognition . That is what pleases or helps others is good , individuals went to look acceptance , moral and disciplined. (in short ) they try to be a good boys and girls..

  <small> convention</small></p>
</a>
<a  class="list-group-item list-group-item-action flex-column align-items-start">
  <div class="d-flex w-100 justify-content-between">
    <h5 class="mb-1"> law and order orientation </h5>
    <small>STAGE 4.</small>
  </div>
  <p class="mb-1">
    individuals show a concern for preserving society as a whole maintaining social order is seen as more goal of high priority. Individual sees laws and orders as socially set standards of acceptance , they need to obey law and order to be accepted in society . Those who breaks the law are in compatible to a particular society.

<small>convention</small>
</p>
</a>
</div>

<h5 class="zuu">POST CONVENTIONAL level Three</h5>
<P>
Also known as principled level. It marked by a growing realization that individual are separate entities from society, people who exhibit post - convention morality view rules as useful but changeable.
</P>
<div class="list-group">
<a  class="list-group-item list-group-item-action flex-column align-items-start ">
  <div class="d-flex w-100 justify-content-between">
    <h5 class="mb-1">Social contract orientation </h5>
    <small>STAGE 5.</small>
  </div>
  <p class="mb-1">
  Social contract  orientation view world as holding different opinions , right and values .law is regarded as social contracts rather than rigid edicts (laws are considered flexible ) “ The greatest good for the greatest number of people “ there is time when they will against the interest of individuals  e.g. Heinz Dilemma
  <small> post-convention</small></p>
</a>
<a  class="list-group-item list-group-item-action flex-column align-items-start">
  <div class="d-flex w-100 justify-content-between">
    <h5 class="mb-1"> Universal ethical principle orientation </h5>
    <small>STAGE 6.</small>
  </div>
  <p class="mb-1">
    People in this stage developed their own set of moral guidelines which may or may not fit the law e.g. Human right, justice, and equality the person would be prepared to act to defend this principle even if it means going against the rest of society.
<small>post-convention</small>

<h5 class="ona">HOW TO ENHANCE MORALITY AMONG LEARNERS</h5>
<u> Virtue is knowledge , all we need to be good is to know what is good </u>
