                    I mean:
                    </button>
                    <button type="button" class="list-group-item list-group-item-action filta">Filter what you put in your mouth, whether that’s food or drink or medicine. Don’t let yourself eat or drink junk. Eat a balanced diet. Question the medication prescribed to you to make sure it’s absolutely necessary and has no less harsh or upsetting alternatives.</button>
                    <button type="button" class="list-group-item list-group-item-action">Filter what comes OUT of your mouth. Watch your speech carefully. Listen first and speak only later. Be concise and to the point. Strive to contribute something positive and useful to the other person when speaking.
                    Filter what comes into your ears and your eyes. Listen only to people and to music that enrich your life in some way. Avoid things that are harmful to your eyes and mental and physical well-being. Read books that improve your life in some tangible way.</button>
                    <button type="button" class="list-group-item list-group-item-action filta">Filter the people you spend time with. You’re the average of the 5 people you spend most of your time with. Choose very carefully and pare away people from your circle that drain your energy and bring bad things like envy/jealousy, gossip/slander and worse. Life is too short to deal with a-holes that prevent you from achieving your potential.</button>
                    <button type="button" class="list-group-item list-group-item-action">Filter carefully how you spend your time. Ask, is what I'm doing right now getting me closer to my goals as a human, professional, family member, artist, scientist, etc.? If not, drop it and do something more productive/constructive ASAP. Seek meaningful experiences above accumulating material goods that add little to your life. Take a digital Sabbath at least one day a week. Stop all electronics 2–3 hours before bed.</button>
                    <button type="button" class="list-group-item list-group-item-action filta">Filter the information streams that come your way. Pare away garbage that brings out the worst human emotions in you (jealousy, envy, anger, hate, etc). Block people and influences in your life that take away from your precious time and ability to focus. Organize your information streams (especially in email, online and on social media) in a way that is manageable, thorough and available for you to access when you have the bandwidth.</button>
                    <button type="button" class="list-group-item list-group-item-action">Filter your spiritual influences. Each person has his path in life and sooner or later seeks a spiritual guide. Find one that shows before he tells and leads by example. Favor actions over words in those whose model you follow spiritually.
                    Adjust and clean your filters periodically.</button>
                    <button type="button" class="list-group-item list-group-item-action filta">People change and mature with age. What worked at 20 may no longer work at 25 or 30 and what did it for you at 30 won’t do at 40. Everything in moderation… Especially moderation :)
                    Once you’ve acquired a filtering mindset, you will have acquired higher standards, confidence in your own abilities and independence from the many corrupting forces all around you.</button>

                    <button type="button" class="list-group-item list-group-item-action bg-danger text-white"> Most importantly, this process will bring you much closer to what you were meant to do in life.</button>

                <button type="button" class="list-group-item list-group-item-action filta">Don’t be so hung up on your penis size.

                <button type="button" class="list-group-item list-group-item-action filta">We know you just want to fall asleep afterwards, but we really appreciate and need that cuddle time before you check out. It prolongs that oxytocin release, which keeps everyone feeling good.</button>
                <button type="button" class="list-group-item list-group-item-action">Tell us what you want. We’re not mind-readers and chances are, you’ll get more when you verbalize it. Especially experimenting with toys, certain sexual acts, and/or role-playing. Most of us have a kinky side, we just might be a bit shy about saying so unless we know you’re up for it as well.
  </button>
                <button type="button" class="list-group-item list-group-item-action filta">If you like BJs, that’s cool, but you should also be willing to reciprocate down there for us, if you get my drift. Tit for tat.</button>
                <button type="button" class="list-group-item list-group-item-action">Don’t be so predictable. Surprise us sometimes. If you’re a morning-sex person, jump us when you get home from work. If nighttime is your thing, start our day off right with some super sexy, slippery, shower sex (say that 5 times really fast). If you’re a wham, bam, thank you ma’am kind of guy, change it up by setting the mood with some candles and a lot of foreplay. And yes, foreplay is important. If you’re Mr. Romantic 24/7, try getting a little down and dirty with a slightly rough quickie. The point is, variety is the spice of life and keeps our sex lives interesting and enjoyable..</button>
                <button type="button" class="list-group-item list-group-item-action filta">When we have sex with you for the first time, know that we are more than likely anxious about how good it was for you, whether we visibly act like it or not. If it was great, tell us so. If it wasn’t, choose your words carefully. You don’t need to be insensitive about expressing that it may not have made the earth move and chances are, we may want to try again to make it better next time. But not if you’re going to be a dick about it.</button>

                <button type="button" class="list-group-item list-group-item-action "> Don’t ask for someone else to join in on the fun with us. We should be more than enough for you and if we’re not, then take a hike..</button>

                <button type="button" class="list-group-item list-group-item-action filta">Yes, we do turn into raging emotional, moody, crying, angry, hormonal monsters during that time of the month. That’s not an act. You try having a bunch of kickboxing ninjas dancing on your lower abdomen for a week, while battling bloat, acne, crying one moment and then wanting to kill everyone that crosses your path the next, all while going through copious amounts of feminine products just to keep from feeling disgusting and then tell us that we’re being overly dramatic. Just be nice to us, bring us chocolate, don’t contradict us too much, and we’ll return to normal in about a week..</button>
                <button type="button" class="list-group-item list-group-item-action">We get that you don’t express your feelings as much as we may do. But we are in awe of men who are willing to open up and share their feelings from time to time instead of bottling it all up. Feelings mean that you’re human. We don’t want to be with unemotional robots. Real men cry. Real men communicate when they’re upset/angry about something. Women value real men who can express themselves..</button>
                <button type="button" class="list-group-item list-group-item-action filta">When you first start dating a girl, don’t talk about yourself all the time. You just come across as being very full of yourself by doing so. Ask us questions. Show that you’re interested in us by sitting back and listening to what we have to say..</button>
                <button type="button" class="list-group-item list-group-item-action">Tell us what you want. We’re not mind-readers and chances are, you’ll get more when you verbalize it.

                </button>
                <button type="button" class="list-group-item list-group-item-action filta">Whenever an argument occurs, women are typically going to want to hash it out to death until we feel it has been satisfactorily dealt with. If you clam up and say you don’t feel like dealing with it and just want to forget about it, you’re running the risk of us holding onto it for much longer. Fastest way to get through it is to just talk with us about it.</button>
                <button type="button" class="list-group-item list-group-item-action">Women want to feel special, even after you’ve been with us for a while. Coming home with flowers for no reason, leaving a note for us in our car to say ‘I Love You’, opening the car/restaurant door for us, holding hands while walking down the street, or giving us a hug or kiss on the forehead while we’re waiting in line at the movies are just a few little things that can make us feel like we landed the biggest catch in the world..</button>
                <button type="button" class="list-group-item list-group-item-action filta">Don’t try to change or shape us to your standards. If you really care about us, you’ll accept the good and the bad. Instead, show you care by helping us to grow into better, more positive versions of ourselves. And know that we’re not trying to change who you are either. We just want to help you grow as well. People who truly care about each other only want the best for each other and will be each other’s biggest supporters..</button>

                <button type="button" class="list-group-item list-group-item-action "> Women need closure when relationships don’t work out. It sucks when they don’t, but it sucks a lot less when we can understand why it didn’t and then take the time to process it and heal. If we’re left with questions, it can take us that much longer to heal, let it go, and move on, especially depending on how much was invested in that relationship. Do the decent, respectful thing and just be honest with women about why. Everything in life is a lesson and we all learn and take things away from every experience we have and every person we meet. Relationships are no different.</button>
